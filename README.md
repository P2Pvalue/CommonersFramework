# The Commoners Framework

This repository holds the NetLogo implementation of a conceptual framework - the ‘Commoners Framework’ - to be used when conceptualising and modelling the behaviour of commons-based peer production (CBPP) communities. The framework is currently being finalised, implemented in NetLogo, and tested on a case study, by Peter Barbrook-Johnson and Antonio Tenorio Fornes.

The Commoners Framework can be used to represent the behaviour and operation of a wide-range of CBPP communities, and similar organisations (such as those that make use of volunteers). It represents the processes behind individuals’ decisions to contribute to, enter or exit, or make ‘friends’ in, communities. Through this representation of individuals’ behaviour, the framework aims to account for patterns observed at the community level.

To open the NetLogo file, you will first need to install NetLogo, which is available at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.

** The Logic of the Framework

The focus of the framework is Commoners. Commoners represent individuals in a community – both those that contribute, and those that consume the product(s) of a community. The core activity of any Commoner is to find tasks in the community, and contribute to them. There ability and likelihood of contributing will depend on their time (a resource Commoners have), interest (a Commoner and task parameter which should match), and skills (a Commoner and task parameter which should match). Commoners may stay in a community, only consuming but not contributing, if no tasks meet their interest. Commoners may make ‘friends’ with others working on the same tasks. Having friends increases the chance of finding tasks and contributing. Friends may be lost over time with a certain probability. Commoners’ probability of leaving a community decreases as they make more contributions and have more friends. Contributions improve the quality, or number, of products in the community. More consumption of products increases the probability of existing consumers of these products continuing to consume them, and new Commoners entering the community.

The framework was developed based on recent empirical findings (Morell et al 2016; Arvidsson et al 2016) on behaviour in communities and was refined using the structural rigour imposed when building an agent-based model (ABM).
