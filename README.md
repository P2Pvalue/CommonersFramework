# The Commoners Framework

This repository holds the NetLogo implementation of a conceptual framework - the ‘Commoners Framework’ - to be used when conceptualising and modelling the behaviour of commons-based peer production (CBPP) communities. The framework is currently being finalised, implemented in NetLogo, and tested on a case study, Peter Barbrook-Johnson and Antonio Tenorio Fornes.

The Commoners Framework can be used to represent the behaviour and operation of a wide-range of CBPP communities, and similar organisations (such as those that make use of volunteers). It represents the processes behind individuals’ decisions to contribute to, enter or exit, or make ‘friends’ in, communities. Through this representation of individuals’ behaviour, the framework aims to account for patterns observed at the community level.

To open the NetLogo file, you will first need to install NetLogo, which is available at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.
